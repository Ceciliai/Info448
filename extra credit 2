I have chosen Profile GPU Rendering as my developer option. 
This option shows the rendering performance of each frame, including the time 
taken to render and whether it meets the 60fps frame rate target. 
It is a valuable tool for developers looking to optimize their appâ€™s UI performance, 
especially when dealing with complex graphics. By using this tool, 
I can see how long it takes for each frame to render and make necessary 
adjustments to ensure a smooth user experience. 
I believe I will use this feature during the course, 
especially when optimizing UI performance, as it can help identify performance bottlenecks
in the app and make the required improvements.
